                    Lorem ipsum is a placeholder text commonly used to demonstrate the visual form
                    of a document or a typeface without relying on meaningful content. Lorem ipsum
                    may be used as a placeholder before final copy is available. It is also used to
                    temporarily replace text in a process called greeking, which allows designers to
                    consider the form of a webpage or publication, without the meaning of the text

                <p>
                    influencing the design. Lorem ipsum is typically a corrupted version of De finibus
                    bonorum et malorum, a 1st-century BC text by the Roman statesman and philosopher
                    Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper
                    Latin. Versions of the Lorem ipsumtext have been used in typesetting at least since
                    the 1960s, when it was popularized by advertisements for Letraset transfer sheets.
                    Lorem ipsum was introduced to the digital world in the mid-1980s, when Aldus employed

                    it in graphic and word-processing templates for its desktop publishing program PageMaker.
                    Other popular word processors, including Pages and Microsoft Word, have since adopted
                    Lorem ipsum, as have many LaTeX packages, web content managers such as Joomla!
                    and WordPress, and CSS libraries such as Semantic UI.
